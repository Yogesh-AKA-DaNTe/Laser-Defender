# Laser Defender

This is a Space Defender like arcade game **Laser Defender** made in _Unity (2018.4.36f1)_.
You control a Red Spaceship with Keyboard and you have to shoot laser beams at your enemies to destroy them and increase your score.
Blue Enemies move fast and they can also shoot laser beams to deal 100 damage while the Green Enemies are slower but their projectiles deal 200 damage.
Your health is displayed on the top left corner of the screen and your score is displayed on the top right corner.
The game will end once your health reaches 0.
